# zig-spoon

zig-spoon is a zig library offering a simple, low-level and allocation free
abstraction for creating TUI programs. zig-spoon takes care of wrangling the
terminal, but unlike other TUI libraries it does not get in the way when you
want to render the interface.

zig-spoon supports the kitty keyboard protocol.

To use zig-spoon, import `import.zig`.
